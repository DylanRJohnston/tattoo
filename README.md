# tattoo

**WIP**, A program to deterministically generate a [Vegv√≠sir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegv%C3%ADsir) like tattoo design from a quantum random number generator, [live preview](https://dylanrjohnston.github.io/tattoo/).

## Why? ##
Under Hugh Everett's "Many Worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics the wave function never undergoes collapse but instead the observer becomes entangled with the experiment existing in a superposition of observing each outcome. Due to the complexity of the observer, the system quickly decoheres into a set of pure (classical) states with each observer / experiment pair being no longer able to interfere with its counterparts, thus giving rise to the subjective experience of wave function collapse and classical mechanics. Therefore the apparent randomess of wave function collapse is a result of a lack of information about our location in the larger wavefunction / quantum multiverse. If you know the encoding (the program used to generate the tattoo) then the tattoo can be decoded back into the number it was generated from and visa versa. Thus the tattoo acts as an address (albeit incomplete) of our location in the quantum multiverse. Other parts of the multiverse that were split with the creation of the tattoo will experience different designs / different addresses.

## TODO ##
- [x] Add storybook
- [x] Revert to absolute coordinates instead of using nested transforms. Too many issues with preserving shape size.
- [x] Add all sigils
- [x] Add all decorators
- [x] Lehmer codes
- [x] Allow user input of tattoo number
- [ ] Quantum Random Number genenerator API
- [ ] Interactive mode
